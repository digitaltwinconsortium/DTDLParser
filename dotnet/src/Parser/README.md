# DTDLParser for .NET
> .NET Standard 2.1 (C#) library

The Digital Twins Definition Language ([DTDL](https://aka.ms/dtdl))) is a language for describing models and interfaces for IoT digital twins. Digital twins are models of entities from the physical environment such as shipping containers, rooms, factory floors, or logical entities that participate in IoT solutions. Using DTDL to describe a digital twin's capabilities enables any IoT platform to leverage the semantics of the entity.

The DTDLParser is a library that can be used to determine whether one or more models are valid according to the language [v2](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/DTDL.v2.md) or [v3](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v3/DTDL.v3.md) specifications, to identify specific modeling errors, and to enable inspection of model contents.
