DTDL model is invalid:
dtmi:example:anInterface;1 has 'contents' value with name 'currentDistance' which has @type that specifies type Telemtry that is an undefined term. Remove @type Telemtry or replace with an appropriate DTDL type -- see https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/tree/master/DTDL.
DTDL model is invalid:
dtmi:example:anInterface;1 has 'contents' value with name 'currentDistance' which requires property 'schema'; however, this property is not present. Add a property 'schema' to the element.
